You are required to write an implementation for the components whose interfaces are described in the attached file. These are the components: Memory, CPU, Computer. All these circuits are described in the fifth chapter of the book relating to the Nand2Tetris project that I included in the e-learning platform. A description of the functioning of these components, and some advice on how to proceed with their implementation, are reported in the "Computer_Hack.pdf" file always available on the e-learning platform.

There are some built-in chips that you must use: "Screen" and "Keyboard" to correctly implement the Hack input/output devices. There are other chips that it is still necessary to use to be able to carry out the tests and to be able to have a correct graphic display inside the HardwareSimulator: "RAM16K" to display the data memory part, "ARegister" and "DRegister" to view the contents of the two internal CPU registers, "PC" and "ALU" to view program counter and ALU, and "ROM32K" to load and view the machine language program to be executed. If you wish, you can also use other built-in chips.
